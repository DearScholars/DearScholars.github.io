<h2> Why create this website? </h2>
<p> The purpose of this website is to share information with more students and hopefully to help students access this information years before we might otherwise meet! </p>

<h2> Who are you? </h2>
<p> I am an American teacher who has helped more than 150 African students to prepare for university and then accept more than $33 million in scholarships to universities including MIT, the University of Chicago, Harvard, Yale and over 60 other universities. I think any student should have access to what I give to a few each year. So here goes... in order to reach more students, I wanted to put as much as possible of what I teach online, so that is what my students and I are trying to do here. </p>

<h2> Personal information? </h2>
<p>I'm from Chicago and attended university in New York and at the University of California. From 2004 to 2007, I was a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa, where I learned to teach and helped to build and open a clinic in a region that did not previously have access to health care. Since 2010, I have lived in Rwanda and the U.S. and have been supporting outstanding students to prepare and access the best quality of education that they are qualified for. My favorite sport is squash, and my favorite thing to do is to help students access high quality education.</p>

<h2> Scholarship advice? </h2>
<p> Currently, this website focuses on helping students to prepare and improve their English reading, writing and critical thinking. Our goal is to help as many students as possible to earn the best possible education, but we do not think that a particular university is the only way to do this. </p>
