<p>
  In this highly personal talk from TEDMED, magician and stuntman David Blaine describes what it took to hold his breath underwater for 17 minutes&mdash;a world record (only two minutes shorter than this entire talk!)&mdash;and what his often death-defying work means to him.
  Warning: do NOT try this at home.

</figure>
<p>
  Simon Sinek presents a simple but powerful model for how leaders inspire action, starting with a golden circle and the question "Why?"
  His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers&mdash;and as a counterpoint Tivo, which (until a recent court victory that tripled its stock price) appeared to be struggling.

<p>
  How does cancer know it's cancer?
  At Jay Bradner's lab, they found a molecule that might hold the answer, JQ1&mdash;and instead of patenting JQ1, they published their findings and mailed samples to 40 other labs to work on.
  An inspiring look at the open-source future of medical research.

</figure>
<p>
  Our lives, our cultures, are composed of many overlapping stories.
  Novelist Chimamanda Adichie tells the story of how she found her authentic cultural voice&mdash;and warns that if we hear only a single story about another person or country, we risk a critical misunderstanding.

</figure>
<p>
  Half of the world's poorest people have something in common: they're small farmers.
  In this eye-opening talk, activist Andrew Youn shows how his group, One Acre Fund, is helping these farmers lift themselves out of poverty by delivering to them life-sustaining farm services that are already in use all over the world.
  Enter this talk believing we'll never be able to solve hunger and extreme poverty, and leave it with a new understanding of the scale of the world's biggest problems.

<p>
  Brene Brown studies human connection&mdash;our ability to empathize, belong, love.
  In a poignant, funny talk at TEDxHouston, she shares a deep insight from her research, one that sent her on a personal quest to know herself as well as to understand humanity.
  A talk to share.

<h2> We Need to Talk about Injustice </h2>

<figcaption> Bryan Stevenson, "We Need to Talk about Injustice" </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  In an engaging and personal talk&mdash;with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks&mdash;human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country's black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives.
  These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness.
